## Deadlines
- Project has to be submitted before Feb 12

## Definitions of data science
- A powerful new approach to make discoveries from data
- An automated way to analyze enormous amount of data and extract information
- A new discipline that combines aspects of statistics, mathematics, programming and visualization to turn data into information  

## Understanding terms
| Term | Significance |
| ---- | ------------ |
| Statistics | What do we do with the data ? |
| Programming | How do we do it ? |
| Domain Knowledge | Is the analysis applicable to the data |

### Example
**Statistics use case** - Imputing missing values  
**Predictive model** - Predicts the future values 90% of the data correctly, out of 100 cases 90 cases are predicted correctly  
A 90% accuracy for loan status is a good and is bad for speech to text conversion. This is where the context plays important role in deciding whether the model's accuracy is good or bad

> When we combine domain expertise and scientific methods with technology we get data science

## Domain expertise and scientific methods
- Data scientists collect data and explore analyze and visualize it. the mathematical and statistical models to find patterns and solutions in the data

### Data analysis can be:
- **Descriptive**: Study a dataset to decipher the details
- **Predictive**: Create a model based on existing information to predict outcome and behavior
- **Prescriptive**: Suggest actions for a given situation using the collected information
- **Reports**: No. of meetings done, No. of proposals, No. of account bagged, No. of invoices raised  

## Data processing and analytics
Modern tools and technologies have made data analytics faster and efficient

#### These technologies help Data Scientists to
- Build and train machine learning models
- Manipulate data and technology
- Build data tools, applications and services
- Extract information from data

## A day in a Data Scientist's life
1. Question (Example: Attrition analysis - If an employee going to resign ?)
2. Data Acquisition (Organization's database HR)
3. Data Wrangling (Data Manipulation, Cleaning and Exploration)
4. Mathematical / Statistical model
   1. Data visualization
   2. Data Report
   3. Data Products
5. Machine Learning

## Basic skills of data
#### A Data Scientist should be able to
1. Ask the right questions
2. Understand data structure
3. Interpret and wrangle data
4. Apply Statistical and mathematical methods
5. Visualize the data and communicate with stakeholders
6. Work as a team player

## Sources of Big Data
Data scientists work with different tyoes of datasets for various purposes. Now that Big Data is generated every second through different media, the role of data scientist has become more important
1. Sensors
2. Social
3. Text
4. Location
5. Image
6. Video
7. Audio
8. Server / Network logs

## The 3 V's of Big Data
Big Data us characterized by the following:
1. Volume
2. Variety
3. Velocity

## Data Analytics and Python
Python deals with each stage

## Python tools and technologies
* Pandas - Data analysis - Tabular Data - Manipulation
* Numpy - Scientific computing
* Scipy - Software of mathematics, science and engineering
* Matplotlib - Graphical computing
* Scikit-learn - Machine learning

## Benefits of Python
1. Easy to learn
2. Open source Software
3. Efficient and multi platform support
4. Huge collection of libraries, functions and modules
5. Big open source community
6. Integrates well with enterprise apps and systems
7. Greater vendor and product support
