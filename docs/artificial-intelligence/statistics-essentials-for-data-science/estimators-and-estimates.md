## Estimator
An approximation depending solely on sample information

## Estimate
A specific value is called an estimate

There are 2 types of Estimates
1. Point Estimates (Single number)
2. Confidence Interval Estimates (Is an Interval)

### Point Estimate
A point estimate is exactly located in the middle of Confidence Interval.

1. The sample mean (x&#x0304;) is a point estimate of the population mean (&#x03BC;)
2. The sample variance (s&#x00B2;) was an estimate of the population variance (&#x03C3;&#x00B2;)

Estimators always have 2 properties
1. Bias
2. Efficiency

- Estimators are like Judges, we are always looking for Unbiased and most efficient Estimators
- An Unbiased estimator has an expected value equal to the population parameter (Eg: x&#x0304; has an expected
  value of &#x03BC;)
- The most efficient estimators are the ones with least variability of outcomes

### Confidence Interval Estimates
Confidence intervals provide much more information and are preferred when making inferences

There are 2 main situations when we can calculate the Confidence intervals for a population
1. Population variance known
2. Population variance unknown

#### Population variance known
- An important assumption in this calculation is that the population is normally distributed
- Even if the population is not normally distributed, we should use the central limit theorem do the normalization for us.
